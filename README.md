## __Our Next Date Night__
### __Project Description__
__*Scope and Functionality*__ - This program was made to randomly generate an idea for your next date night! There are several dozen pre-populated ideas that will randomly generate depending on the button you press.

1. __$$$__ - When pressed, the generator will recommend date ideas that *cost money*
2. __FREE__ - When pressed, the generator will recommend date ideas that *are free*
3. __???__ - When pressed, the generator will recommend *a mix of date ideas from both categories*

To reroll the suggestion, simply press another button.

__*Motivation*__ - Allows me to demonstrate and test my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript by applying the concepts learned through my program at UofA.
